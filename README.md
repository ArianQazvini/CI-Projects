# CI-Projects
This repository is a collection of three projects of Computational Intelligence course at AUT

1. **Neural Networks from Scratch**: A deep dive into building neural networks with a focus on understanding the underlying principles of backpropagation, gradient descent, and more.
   - Repository: [Neural Networks From Scratch](https://github.com/ArianQazvini/ArtificialNeuralNetworks-ComputationalIntelligence-AUT)

2. **Fuzzy Self-Driving Car**: A fuzzy logic-based controller for self-driving cars that leverages rule-based decision-making to handle different driving situations.
   - Repository: [Fuzzy Self-Driving Car](https://github.com/ArianQazvini/Fuzzy-SelfDriving-Car)

3. **Genetic Algorithm**: An implementation of genetic algorithms, showcasing optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution to solve problems in AI.
